Ganguly\\'s father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness.\\nGanguly was educated at St. Xavier\\'s Collegiate School, Kolkata. He was then graduated in commerce from the St. Xavier\\'s College, Kolkata.\\nSince the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team.

The origins of its name are uncertain. According to some, the stadium is named after the Eden Gardens park where it is located, itself named after the Eden sisters, Emily and Fanny, of Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India (1836–1842). Initially named the \\'Auckland Circus Gardens\\', the park was renamed to the \\'Eden Gardens\\' in 1841.\\nHowever, according to popular culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the zamindar (landlord) of Janbazar, Kolkata and husband of Rani Rashmoni, gifted one of his biggest gardens, Mar Bagan, besides the river Hooghly, to Lord Auckland and his sister Emily Eden in gratitude for their help in saving his third daughter from a fatal disease. The garden was then renamed to the Eden Gardens.\\nThe cricket grounds were built between Babughat and Fort William. The stadium is in the B. B. D. Bagh area of the city, near the State Secretariat and across from the Calcutta High Court.\\nThe first Test match at the venue was held in 1934 between England and India, its first One Day International in 1987 between India and Pakistan and its first T20 international in 2011 between India and England. The 1993 Hero Cup semi-final featuring India and South Africa was the first day/night match.\\n\\nThe stadium also hosted matches of the inaugural edition of Nehru Cup in 1982.

Roy.\\n\\n\\n=== 1987 renovation ===\\nThe stadium\\'s capacity was expanded to 100,000 from 40,000 for the 1987 World Cup. The expansion also included renovations to the press ure. 42 columns were added to provide the support for large roofs and multi-tiered covered stands. Even after the renovation, not all seats were covered and many sections lacked individual seats.\\nHowever, match day attendance of more than 100,000 spectators has been recorded on at least 6 occasions until the early 2000s.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011 renovation ===\\nEden Gardens underwent renovation for the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma. Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.

India won the match by six wickets—its second World Cup win after the 1983 tournament—and became the third team to have won the title more than once, after Australia (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007) and the West Indies (1975 and 1979). \\nIndia became the first country to win Cricket World Cup in their own country.\\nBoth teams had progressed through three stages to reach the final. India had won all but two matches to that point, losing to South Africa and tying with England in the group stage. Sri Lanka had won all but one completed match, against Pakistan. The Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara chose to bat first after winning the toss. The team scored slowly until the 17th over when they lost both their openers. Sangakkara added 62 runs with Mahela Jayawardene before being dismissed for 48 runs. Although wickets kept falling at one end, Jayawardene scored 103 runs in 88 balls; he was involved in a partnership of 66 runs with Thisara Perera. The pair took Sri Lanka\\'s total to 274 runs at the close of the innings.\\nIn reply, India lost their opener Virender Sehwag to the second ball of the innings, out LBW by Lasith Malinga. Sachin Tendulkar, too, got out quickly. The next set of batsmen, Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli, added 83 runs in 15 overs before the latter got out in the 22nd over. India captain MS Dhoni, promoting himself up the order, joined Gambhir and they both added 109 runs, an Indian record in a World Cup final. Gambhir got out for 97 runs in the 42nd over. India chased down the total and won the match by six wickets in the 49th over. Dhoni was declared the \"man of the match\" for scoring 91 runs, while his compatriot Yuvraj Singh was awarded the \"man of the tournament\".\\nThe match was watched by about 42,000 spectators at the venue and about 135 million viewers on television in India. This was the second time in World Cup history that a host nation won the final and the first time to win on their home ground.\\nThe 2011 Cricket World Cup was the tenth World Cup, organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The competition took place between 19 February and 2 April 2011. Co-hosted by India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, the tournament was the third World Cup to be played in the Indian subcontinent. The ICC ruled out Pakistan citing security reasons. There were 14 participating teams, which included four associate members of the ICC—Kenya, Canada, Ireland and Netherlands.\\nThe match was the tenth World Cup final and was hosted at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. It was the first time the city has hosted a World Cup final, and was the second final to be hosted by India, after the 1987 final held at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. The 2011 final was the first to feature two teams from the same continent, and the first time that two co-hosts contested the final.\\nIndia were making their 3rd appearance in a World Cup final. Previously, they won the final in 1983, and lost in 2003. Sri Lanka was appearing in their third World Cup final; breakthrough winners against Australia in 1996 they finished as runners up (also to Australia) in the previous World Cup in 2007. Prior to this match, India and Sri Lanka had met each other seven times in World Cup history with Sri Lanka ahead with four wins and two defeats and one game ending in a no-result. In One Day Internationals, India led Sri Lanka with 75 victories against 52 victories for Sri Lanka, while 11 matches had ended with no result.\\nThe final generated huge interest. The President of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa, a known cricket enthusiast, announced he would attend the match along with his sons. Following this, the Indian President Pratibha Patil also announced her decision to attend the match.\\nIt was the second instance of ICC events and was the repeat of 2002 ICC Champions Trophy final where India shared the trophy with Sri Lanka after being washed out by rain.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Cricket_World_Cup_final'}),\n",

Ganguly's father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness.\\nGanguly was educated at St. Xavier's Collegiate School, Kolkata. He was then graduated in commerce from the St. Xavier's College, Kolkata.\\nSince the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth standard at that time.\\nDespite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so he could use his brother's sporting equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he was enrolled in a cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.\\nHe is married to Indian classical dancer dancer Dona Ganguly, with whom he has a daughter Sana (b. 2001).\", metadata={'title': 'Sourav Ganguly', 'summary': 'Sourav Chandidas Ganguly ( ; natively spelled as Gangopadhyay; born 8 July 1972), also known as Dada (meaning \"elder brother\" in Bengali), is an Indian cricket commentator and former cricketer.

      "This page presents some of the notable achievements of Sachin Tendulkar, a former Indian cricketer, universally regarded as one of the best batsmen of all time. Debates on Tendulkar's precise rank amongst his predecessors are unlikely to conclude soon. He was the sport's first batsman to score a double century (200 runs not out) in a single One Day International match, and is so far the only player to have scored 100 centuries in internationals. He played first-class cricket for 26 years and one day, whilst his international career spanned exactly 24 years from 15 November 1989 to 16 November 2013.\n",

      "Sachin Tendulkar is a retired Indian cricketer who is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, he is the most prolific run-scorer in international cricket. Tendulkar has scored the highest number of centuries (100 or more runs) in Test matches and One Day International (ODI) matches organised by the International Cricket Council. His total of 51 centuries in Test matches is a world record for highest number of centuries by a batsman and his 49 centuries in ODI matches are the second highest number of centuries after Virat Kohli. He became the first and only cricketer to score 100 international centuries when he made 114 against Bangladesh in March 2012.\n",
      "After making his Test debut in 1989, Tendulkar achieved his first century against England at Old Trafford, Manchester in 1990; he made 119 not out. In Test matches, Tendulkar has scored centuries against all the Test cricket playing nations, and is the second batsman to score 150 against each of them. He has scored a century in at least one cricket ground of all Test cricket playing nations, except Zimbabwe. In October 2010, Tendulkar went past Brian Lara's record of 19 scores of 150 or more by hitting his 20th against Australia in Bangalore. He made his highest score in 2004, when he made 248 not out against Bangladesh at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka. Tendulkar has scored six double centuries and remained unbeaten on 15 occasions. His centuries have come in 30 different cricket grounds, with 27 of them being scored in venues outside India. Tendulkar has been dismissed nine times between scores of 90 and 99.\n",

He made 110 against Australia in the third match of the Singer World Series at the R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo in September 1994. In ODIs, Tendulkar has scored centuries against 11 different opponents. He has scored centuries against all cricketing nations that have permanent One Day International status. He was the first batsman to score a double century in ODIs, which he scored against South Africa at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium, Gwalior in 2010. He has scored 19 ODI centuries in India, compared to 30 in away or neutral venues. Seven of these centuries were hit at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium.

      "Sachin Tendulkar, ( ; pronounced [sətɕin teːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. Hailed as the world's most prolific batsman of all time, he is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 runs, respectively. He also holds the record for receiving the most player of the match awards in international cricket. Tendulkar was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by nomination from 2012 to 2018.\n",
      "Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for over 24 years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India. He had previously been named \"Player of the Tournament\" at the 2003 World Cup.\n",
      "Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of India: the Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel Ratna Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008). After Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. He was the first sportsperson to receive the reward and, as of 2023, is the youngest recipient. In 2010, Time included Tendulkar in its annual list of the most influential people in the world. Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 International Cricket Council (ICC) Awards.\n",
      "Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012, he retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match. Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs. In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only specialist batsman of the post–World War II era, along with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team. In 2019, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. On 24 April 2023, the Sydney Cricket Ground unveiled a set of gates named after Tendulkar and Brian Lara on the occasion of Tendulkar's 50th birthday and the 30th anniversary of Lara's innings of 277 at the ground.\n"
